<h2 class="headText"><span>Is Rainfall Contaminating Coastal Water?<span class='spacer'></span></h2>
</div>

  <p class = "description"> Water Contamination in oceans is becoming more and more widespread.
    This detrimental to the health of the ocean
  and directly imapcts wildlife and people who depend on the ocean.
  Coliform bacteria are known to act as indicator organisms to detect
    presense of pathogens. These pathogens can impact human health with
    fever, respiratory illnesses, and such.
    The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts coastal water contamination (concentration of coliform bacteria) as a result of factors such as rainfall, turbidity, pH, and temperature. In order to do this, we found existing data on the these factors and tried to find correlations between them in order to develop a predictor model.

<h2 class="bannerText"><span>Since the Industrial Revolution, ocean water pH has fallen by 0.1. Because the pH scale is logarithmic, this is a 30% increase in ocean acidity. Various models predict that ocean water could around 150% more acidic by the end of the century.
