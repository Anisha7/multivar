  <p class = "description">Water Contamination in oceans is becoming more and more widespread.
    This detrimental to the health of the ocean
  and directly imapcts wildlife and people who depend on the ocean.
  Coliform bacteria are known to act as indicator organisms to detect
    presense of pathogens. These pathogens can impact human health with
    fever, respiratory illnesses, and such. We used factors that
    indicate the presense of Coliform bacteria to model the levels of water
    contamination and predict future levels of contamination in the Monterey Bay.

  <p class= "description">
    We found causal relationships between rainfall and other factors, such as nitogen levels,
    temperature, and dissolved oxygen saturation, and created a model to predict the
    effect of rainfall on coliform levels. We looked at how rainfall affects the factors and
    how the factors affect water contamination.
