<p class= SourceName> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) </p>
<p class= SourceDescription>The NOAA is a government institution that provides weather, water, and climate data to enhance the public health and protect property. The organization provides live rainfall data, which is used in our project to determine rainfall over a long period of time and in conjunction with other data to help construct a visualization of water contamination.  </p>
<p class= SourceName> The Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) </p>
<p class= SourceDescription> CeNCOOS is a collaborative source of data that seeks to help inform decisions about the oceans. For our project, we utilized turbidity data from the Santa Cruz station, a part of the Santa Cruz Ocean Observation Platform (SCOOP) located at the Santa Cruz wharf and maintained by UC Santa Cruz. The platform provides near real-time data of water salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen, and pH via a pump located 1m below the water surface that reports on conditions every 5 minutes. </p>
